                                <p> This feeling is also close to us, and that's why we made a game in which everyone
                                    can spend time with their ideal 2d waifu, moreover, make money on it! If there is a

                            <p>Do you remember the old tamagotchi games? Where do you need to take care of your pet:

                                it, caress it, play with it?

                            <p>We thought, why not make a similar concept on blockchain with 2d tyan so that you can
                                talk,
                                feed, caress and play with your girl and earn money for it?
                            </p>
                            <p>Of course, that's not all! Each girl can be dressed the way you want (and the way she

                                of course!), choose the best room for her, and she will delight you every day with her
